Here’s a rewritten `README.md` that emphasizes **versioning** and why using tagged releases is better for CDN loading:

## Overview

This repository provides an **example plugin** for the [DQM Webpage Frontend](https://github.com/jaca230/DQM_webpage).
It demonstrates how to define custom figures (plots, tables, labels), bundle them with Rollup, and register them with the DQM frontend’s plugin system.

👉 This repo is a **good place to clone** if you want to start building your own plugin. Just copy it, change the figure definitions, and rebuild.

## Usage

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin.git
cd DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin
npm install
```

### 2. Build plugin bundles

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates:

* `dist/plugin.es.js` → ES module (preferred for DQM)
* `dist/plugin.iife.js` → IIFE bundle (fallback for eval/script loading)

---

## Loading Into DQM Webpage

Once built and pushed to GitHub, the plugin bundles can be served automatically by **jsDelivr**.

### Development (main branch)

For quick iteration you can load directly from `main`:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin@main/dist/plugin.es.js
```

⚠️ **Warning:** this URL will always serve the *latest commit* on `main`, which may change without notice. This is fine for development but not stable for production dashboards.

---

### Production (versioned tags – recommended)

For stability, create a version tag in Git and use it in your CDN URL:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then load the plugin via:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin@v1.0.0/dist/plugin.es.js
```

for example, the link will change based on your github username, repository name, and version number.

Benefits of versioning:

* Dashboards always load the exact code you released.
* Future updates won’t break older dashboards.
* You can safely roll out new versions without disrupting existing layouts.

---

## Extending

* Edit or add new figure factories under `figures/`.
* Register them in `index.js`.
* Rebuild with `npm run build`.
* Tag a new release when ready, e.g. `v1.1.0`.

This repository is intended as a **template**. Fork it, rename it, and adapt it to your experiment’s figures.

## Versioning and Package Metadata

Your plugin’s identity and version are controlled by the **`package.json`** file.
This metadata is important both for development and for CDN loading via jsDelivr.

### Example `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "dqmweb-midas-figures-plugin",   // unique package/repo name
  "version": "1.0.0",                      // semantic version (major.minor.patch)
  "description": "Custom figures for DQM Webpage",
  "main": "rollup.config.mjs",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rollup -c"
  },
  "author": "Your Name or Collaboration",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.27.7",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.27.2",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.27.1",
    "@rollup/plugin-babel": "^6.0.4",
    "@rollup/plugin-commonjs": "^28.0.6",
    "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve": "^16.0.1",
    "rollup": "^4.44.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

### Fields to Update

* **`name`**

  * Should match your repo/project.
  * Avoid generic names like `example_plugin`.
  * Example: `"name": "dqmweb-myexperiment-plugin"`

* **`version`**

  * Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

    * `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
    * `1.0.0` → initial release
    * `1.1.0` → new features, backward compatible
    * `2.0.0` → breaking changes
  * Each release you **tag in git** should also update this field for clarity.

* **`description`**

  * A short sentence about what figures the plugin provides.

* **`author`**

  * Your name, or your collaboration (e.g., `"PIONEER Collaboration"`).

* **`license`**

  * Use `"MIT"` unless you have other requirements.

---

### Why It Matters

1. **Clarity** – Anyone cloning the repo knows what it is.
2. **Version tracking** – Makes it easier to know what’s deployed when you push new tags (`v1.1.0`).
3. **CDN stability** – When combined with git tags, dashboards can lock onto a specific version (e.g., `v1.1.0`) and not break from future changes.
