Here’s a clean **README.md** you can drop into your `DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin` repo. It frames the repo as a **starter template** for anyone who wants to clone and build their own plugin:

## Overview

This repository provides an **example plugin** for the [DQM Webpage Frontend](https://github.com/jaca230/DQM_webpage).
It demonstrates how to define custom figures (plots, tables, labels), bundle them with Rollup, and register them with the DQM frontend’s plugin system.

This is a **good place to clone** if you want to start building your own plugin. Just copy this repo, change the figure definitions, and rebuild.

## Usage

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin.git
cd DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin
npm install
```

### 2. Build plugin bundles

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates:

* `dist/plugin.es.js` → ES module (preferred for DQM)
* `dist/plugin.iife.js` → IIFE bundle (fallback for eval/script loading)

---

## Loading Into DQM Webpage

Once built and pushed to GitHub, the plugin bundles are served automatically by jsDelivr.

Example URLs:

```text
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin@main/dist/plugin.es.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jaca230/DQM_webpage_midas_figures_plugin@main/dist/plugin.iife.js
```

To load:

1. Open the DQM Webpage frontend.
2. Go to the **Plugin Management Modal**.
3. Paste the CDN URL for your plugin.
4. The figures defined here (`MyPlot`, `MyTable`, `MyLabel`) will appear in the figure list.

---

## Extending

* Edit or add new figure factories under `figures/`.
* Register them in `index.js`.
* Rebuild with `npm run build`.

This repository is intended as a **template**. Fork it, rename it, and adapt to your experiment’s figures.

Do you want me to also include a **step-by-step "How to fork this into your own plugin"** section (like a short tutorial for students/new contributors), or keep the README lean?
